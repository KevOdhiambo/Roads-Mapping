# Oloisukut Conservancy

In this project we're looking at the Oloisukut conservancy, located in the Narok County, Masaai Mara Game Reserve. Using the conservancy's spatial file, my objective was to identify the secondary and Unclassified roads in the area, as well as all the posible roads in the conserancy using R.
looking the files in this folder, you'll be able to see the differnt plottings for the two set objectives.
